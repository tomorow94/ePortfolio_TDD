# TDD - Test Driven Development
This repository goes with ePortfolio about TDD and how to do it. My example project contains a very simple add and multyplay functionality for a calculator. In addition to that I wrote several tests for the two existing functions and a future not existing substract function to get the idea how to proceed.

### JUnit4
To get all this working JUnit4 should be installed in your favourite Java IDE.

### Presentation
If you are interested in the slides of my presentation, you can find them as .pdf or .pptx right [here](https://github.com/tomorow94/ePortfolio_TDD/tree/master/documents).

## Task
### 1. Add a failing test
Write a new specific test with the intend to let it initially fail.
### 2. Run the test and see if it fails
Run the test you just wrote and see if it really is failing. If not: write another test.
### 3. Code
Write just enough code to make the test pass.
### 4. Run all tests
Run all the tests and see if they all turn green. If tests are failing, go back to 3.
### 5. Refactor
Refactor the code if needed. If there is nothing to refactor, then start over with writing a new test.
